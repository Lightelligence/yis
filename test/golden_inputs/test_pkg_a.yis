doc_summary: This is an example of what a package file could look like.
doc_verbose: |
  This is now verbose documentation.
  It doesn't work yet.
localparams:
  - name: HERO_WIDTH
    width: 32
    value: 36
    doc_summary: Width of hero bus around the bag.

  - name: ANOTHER_PARAM
    width: 6
    value: 2
    doc_summary: This is a different parameter than the first.
    doc_verbose: |
      This field has extra verbose documentation surrounding it
      for reasons that might be clear later. The intent of these different fields
      is so that when a block interface uses a struct or enum in an interface
      definition, we can copy over the doc_summary and keep it inline, but for
      more information point to the package definition for the whole long-form
      documentation.

  - name: THIRD_PARAM
    width: HERO_WIDTH
    value: ANOTHER_PARAM
    doc_summary: This paramter has a paramterized width from the first param and a value from the second.
enums:
  - name: CYCLE_TYPE_E
    width: 4
    values:
      - name: IDLE
        doc_summary: The bus is idle this cycle.
      - name: VALID
        doc_summary: The command on the bus this is valid and there will be future VALID cycles for this transaction.
        doc_verbose: |
          The enum value is so complicated it needs its own
          verbose documentation that none of the other values in this enum need.
      - name: DONE
        doc_summary: The command on the bus this is valid and this is the last cycle of data.
    doc_summary: Indicates a command type of IDLE, VALID, or DONE.
    doc_verbose: |
      I'm writing this verbose documentation so that we have something to attempt to link in
      for cycle_type.
structs:
  - name: hero_write_t
    doc_summary: "A struct that wraps all fields needed for a single hero write."
    fields:
      - name: cycle_type
        type: CYCLE_TYPE_E
        doc_summary: type.doc_summary
        doc_verbose: type.doc_verbose
      - name: wdat
        type: logic
        width: HERO_WIDTH
        doc_summary: width.doc_summary
      - name: clk_en
        type: logic
        width: 1
        doc_summary: Clock enable for the bus
